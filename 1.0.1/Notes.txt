Accidentally deleted the first version, so here is the updated version

Features - 
	Player that can shoot bullets and can take damage (can't die yet)
	Camera that follows the player smoothly
	World with a checkboard-like grass and is 5000x5000
	Enemies and an Enemy Spawner. Enemies will not cluster together and will follow the player
	Health for both the enemies and player, only enemies can die

Known Bugs -
	Nothing blocking the world edges, so just white everywhere
